                            I've accomplished other things in my life such as being an NCAA athlete, getting my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, 
                            obtaining a certificate in Data Science and a welding certification. I enjoy knitting, reading, and debating anything and 
                            everything with anyone who will partake in a converstaion. I have a mini Australian shepherd named Mala and live in Seattle
                            , Washington.
